## Ansible Concepts

* Controller - the Machine where Ansible installed on it and will manage the whole process
* Inventory - a file has all servers you will manage and they listed in groups as a category or standalone host
* Playbook -a file written in YAML format and itâ€™s a human readable language , and it has all tasks that you want to execute it on the targeted machines
* Task - a block of single procedure to execute something on the remote target like install package (ex:- Nginx)
* Role - A pre-defined way for organizing playbooks for facilitating the provisioning process
* Facts - Global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces
